SUMMARY: Website for the Smithsonian Asian Pacific Alliance's new exhibition SIGHTLINES in Washington D.C. I collaborated with a cross functional team at Trivium Interactive (as Front End Engineer) on the development of this site.

MY ROLE: I worked with the team's designer who provided wireframes, upon which I built out the custom theme for the site. In addition to basic coding of the theme's templates, functions, and a custom plugin, I also contributed heavily to the design (color palette and typography) and was tasked with implementing all responsive design choices.

NEW CHALLENGES: The client wanted a highly interactive and animated feel, so I was able to gain new skills adding custom moving, scroll-based, and hover elements using CSS3 and Javascript. SEO and Accessibility were also paramount to this project. I spent more time than ever before conducting ADA scans and adding accessibility features to the site, to make sure it was compliant and user friendly. I also incorporated multiple APIs into the theme and created my first standalone Gutenberg blocks.
